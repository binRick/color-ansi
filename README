Color v1.1
----------

ABOUT
-----
Color is a convenience tool to ease the use of ANSI coloring in your shell
scripts by hiding the escape sequences through command substitution.


COMPILING
---------
Just type 'make' to compile Color, and 'make install' to install it as
/usr/local/bin/color.


INVOKING
--------
Invoke color with no parameters to see usage information and an example.
Be sure your terminal supports ANSI escape sequences! :-)


USING
-----
To use ANSI color in your shell scripts, place a color command, wrapped in $()
or `` depending on your shell, before the text you want colorized, and then a
$(color off) after the text.


EXAMPLE
-------
#!/bin/bash
echo -n "We have $(color bd)bold$(color off), $(color red)red$(color off), " 
echo "and $(color ltcyan magenta)light cyan on magenta$(color off)."

Note: on some terminals, bold and underline may appear simply as different
colors instead of actually being bold or underlined. This is a function of
your terminal program, not Color.


SUGGESTIONS
-----------
I welcome any suggestions, bug reports, etc. that you may have about Color.

Anyway, that's about all I have to say. Enjoy the program!
